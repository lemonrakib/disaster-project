                    <p>Children are extremely vulnerable during emergencies, including natural disasters. India is among

                        puts a large number of children at risk.

                <h1 class="body-head"> How often should you send donation letters</h1>
                <p class="body-para">Many fundraising professionals would recommend around four direct mail donation
                    letters per year, with one email per month. However, this number will vary depending on both the
                    donor and the nonprofit.
                    A good idea is to send out a survey asking for communication preferences as soon as someone makes a
                    donation or opts into any of your email lists. Then, record that data within your fundraising
                    platform and refer to it when you schedule future correspondences.</p>
